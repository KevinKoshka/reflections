When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to work with someone else or from different computers.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To actually decide for myself rather than HAVING A FUCKING MACHINE FROM SKYNET DECIDIDING FOR ME. I DON'T WANT THE JUDGEMENT DAY TO COME. DO YOU? YOU ARE AN ANTI HUMAN PIECE OF SHIIIIIIEEEEEEEET.
